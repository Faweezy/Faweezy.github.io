All of the above folders and documents are for my protfolio website which we submitted months ago.

To view the work I have done for the year, start with the folder the beginning.

Then move to the Projects folder.

Then move to the coding exercises(js) folder

Finally is the folder Backend, which I am currently finishing up before moving strictly to React.
